Welcome, this repo contains our culture. You can think of it as our playbook or handbook.  

In here you will find what makes us tick, the rules we play by and some templates we used to help organise our work.  

## Our Rulebook
 - [Five Pillars](./docs/five-pillars.md)
 - [Communication](./docs/communication.md)
 - [Day to Day](./docs/day-to-day.md)

## How do we do it?
 - [Tools of the Trade](./docs/tools.md) - the "new starter" software
 - [Designing Things](./docs/design.md) - make sure it's worth building
 - [Building and Coding Things](./docs/development.md) - build it quick, build it robust and scalable
 - [Hosting Things](./docs/devops.md) - in the cloud a.k.a. DevOps/Infrastructure

## Our History
This is how a lot of who we are and what we do came to be.
